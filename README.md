	UX
	
		The munch online cookbook takes on a modern design by implementing features from the Materialize.css framework. A fixed navbar remains a constant theme throughout, with orange being the dominant colour throughout each of the templates (e.g. form input underlines). The application was designed to work just as well on devices with small screens as those with larger ones.

		A sidenav consisting of the munch logo, as well as options to filter and sort has been implemented (detail of which can be found in the Features section below).



		All of the recipes on the home page are displayed on Materialize cards, each showing a photo of the recipe, the recipe title and it's difficulty. Users can also see how many views that particular recipe has attracted as well as likes. By pressing the thumb button on the homepage, the user can like a recipe at a glance.

		Add Recipe


		The user is redirected to this page when they would like to add a recipe of their own. On this page are a number of inputs that the user must fill in. Each follows the colour scheme and theme of the project, and carefully guides the user through the form with intelligent labels and icons.

		The user can be as detailed or as simplistic as they like when entering recipe ingredients and amounts. The user has the option to add as many ingredients (with respective amounts) as they'd like. Functionality to detect if required fields do not have a value has also been implemented.

		Similarly, the user can add as many steps in the method as they'd like to describe how to prepare and cook the recipe.

		A dropdown for the cuisine chooser, a slider for the number of people served by the recipe, and radio buttons to determine the difficulty of the recipe result in uniform data output by the form, and a pleasant user experience.

		Edit Recipe
		This page mimics many of the properties of the add recipe page, to help the user identify which fields they would like to update faster.

		If the user wants to save the changes, or discard them, familiar green (for success) and red (for warning) buttons are displayed at the bottom of the page respectively.

		Delete Recipe


		The user also has the option to delete a recipe from the page. To prevent users accidentally deleting recipes, a modal flashes up asking the user to confirm their decision before the recipe is permanently deleted from the database.

		Responsiveness Testing
		This application has been tested on all mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes with the Firefox Mozilla Developer Tools and Google Chrome Developer Tools. From these tests, all issues have been resolved.

		Code Validation
		The HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for this application has been run through and validated by The W3C Markup Validation Service and JSHint, with the exception of the validation service seeing the Flask/Jinja markup as errors.

		Bugs
		In the 'Edit Recipe' form, the 'Category' and 'Allergens' dropdown list will not have preselected values.

		Register functionality bug - this function was missing a key line of code which did not allow the user to successfully register into the application and therefore threw a "Method Not Allowed" Exception. This has been corrected and re-tested.
		
	Testing Procedure
			
		Programatical Testing
		Created a simple unit test in tests.py which initially failed.
		These tests made a range of assertions which can be seen in the comments of each test in that file.
		Once a full range of tests were created, I then created utils.py with utility functions that related to each test.
		These functions are explained in the comments within utils.py
		When the functions were complete, all tests were then correctly passing, and I ensured they continued to pass while developing further code.
		Manual Testing
		used Developer Tools in browser to test smaller view-ports and mobile responsiveness
		Try to create a new recipe and select an existing Author Name
		Try to created a new Author Name via the Add Recipe page
		Try to create a new recipe
		Check if the user is correctly redirect to Add Recipe upon saving the new Author
		Check if the success message will be displayed (on All Recipes) updon saving a new recipe
		Try to edit/update an existing recipe
		Try to delete an existing recipe


	Deployment
	
		The source code for this application can be found on Github and the application itself has been deployed onto Heroku. There is no difference between the GitHub code and the code in the live application.

		It can be installed with the following steps:

		Download the git repository
		Sign up/login to Heroku.com
		From the dashboard click Create New App
		Enter a unique name and your region and click Create
		From your command line, enter heroku to ensure heroku is installed (if not installed this can be done with sudo snap install --classic heroku)
		heroku login
		Enter your credentials for heroku.com
		sudo pip3 install Flask
		sudo pip3 install pymongo
		sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
		echo web: python run.py > Procfile
		git add .
		git commit -m "initial commit"
		git push -u heroku master
		heroku ps:scale web=1
		Make sure to set debug to True.
		From heroku.com app settings: set config vars to IP : 0.0.0.0, PORT : 5000 and MONGO_URI :mongodb://[username]:[password]@ds129914.mlab.com:29914/online_cookbook, ensuring that you update the username and password accordingly.
		Click More > Restart all Dynos
		Application is live at https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/
		This application's source code has been modified since the initial deployment - this was to fix a major bug regarding the register functionality, and to also tidy up the indentation of the HTML templates.
