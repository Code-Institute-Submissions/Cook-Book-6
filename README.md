UX
	
	Mariam'S Munch takes on a modern design by implementing features from the bootstrap.css framework.
	The application was designed to work just as well on devices with small screens as those with larger ones.

	All of the recipes on the home page are displayed on bootstrap cards, each showing a photo of the recipe, the recipe title, description, duration and chef name.
		
	Add Recipe
![](mockup/add-recipe.png)

		The user is redirected to this page when they would like to add a recipe of their own. On this page their are a number of inputs that the user must fill in, it has intelligent labels and icons to guide the user.

		The user can be as detailed or as simplistic as they like when entering recipe ingredients. 
		The user has the option to add as many ingredients (with respective amounts) as they'd like.
		Similarly, the user can add as many steps in the method as they'd like to describe how to prepare and cook the recipe.

		A dropdown for the cuisine chooser and category.

	Edit Recipe
		
		This page mimics many of the properties of the add recipe page, to help the user identify which fields they would like to update faster.

		If the user wants to save the changes, or discard them, buttons are displayed at the bottom of the page respectively.

	Delete Recipe

		The user also has the option to delete a recipe from the page. To prevent users accidentally deleting recipes, a modal flashes up asking the user to confirm their decision before the recipe is permanently deleted from the database.

	Testing Procedure
			
		
		Manual Testing
		
		used Developer Tools in browser to test smaller view-ports and mobile responsiveness
		Try to create a new recipe
		Try to edit/update an existing recipe
		Try to delete an existing recipe


	Deployment
	
		The source code for this application can be found on Github and the application itself has been deployed onto Heroku. There is no difference between the GitHub code and the code in the live application.

		It can be installed with the following steps:

		Download the git repository
		
		Sign up/login to Heroku.com
		From the dashboard click Create New App
		Enter a unique name and your region and click Create
		From your command line, enter heroku to ensure heroku is installed (if not installed this can be done with sudo snap install --classic heroku)
		heroku login
		Enter your credentials for heroku.com
		sudo pip3 install Flask
		sudo pip3 install pymongo
		sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
		echo web: python run.py > Procfile
		git add .
		git commit -m "initial commit"
		git push -u heroku master
		heroku ps:scale web=1
		Make sure to set debug to True.
		From heroku.com app settings: set config vars to IP : 0.0.0.0, PORT : 5000 and MONGO_URI :mongodb://[username]:[password]@ds129914.mlab.com:29914/online_cookbook, ensuring that you update the username and password accordingly.
		Click More > Restart all Dynos
		Application is live at https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/
		This application's source code has been modified since the initial deployment - this was to fix a major bug regarding the register functionality, and to also tidy up the indentation of the HTML templates.
